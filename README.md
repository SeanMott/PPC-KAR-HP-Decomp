# PPC-KAR-HP-Decomp
Yet Another Decomp of Base NA KAR and the Hack Pack, but with :sparkles: PPC :sparkles:

Power PC To C Compiler (PPC, formly [PPCC](https://github.com/SeanMott/PPCC)). Is a WIP transcompiler for converting Game Cube ROMs to C++ and static analysis of assembly.

This current version uses [PPCC](https://github.com/SeanMott/PPCC)'s struct renaming functionality. This takes a directory of assembly code generated by [DTK](https://github.com/encounter/decomp-toolkit/tree/main) along with the symbol data. It then itterates over the code generating struct and their type data of internal memeber variables. It then renames them according to the data. Ie: `lbl_obj_4353454354354` becomes `LBL_STRUCT_FLOAT_32` where 32 is the current number of structs containing only floats that have been found.

# What is PPC and PPCC?

[PPCC](https://github.com/SeanMott/PPCC) was the first/alpha version of PPC. It has been phased out and the functionality is being brought over to [PPC](https://github.com/SeanMott/PPC). Along with having a better name, it also will improve the lexing speed and provide better functionality.

Both rely on [DTK](https://github.com/encounter/decomp-toolkit/tree/main), a decompalation tool for Game Cube and Wii made by [Encounter](https://github.com/encounter)

Eventually this repo will contain both the typed ASM and sudo-C++ generated by PPC.

## BASE NA

BaseNA is a decompiled version of North American Kirby Air Ride (ID: `GKYE01` Hash: `977533bb96e6a16e127946396489be1b4164ac42`)

```
BaseNA
    -asm || all the assembly code produced by DTK and given type structs from PPC
    -splits || the splits of all the sections of the Dol
    -symbols || all the symbols generated by DTK and given struct type information by PPC
```

## Symbol Maps

There have been a *lot* of symbol maps for KAR over the years. This repo grabs all of them and brings them togeather in one place. The goal is to port theses synbols into the BaseNA and Hack Pack decomp. Theses will be a somewhat tedious but PPC will update the symbol data.

Most are in the repo but some have a Git URL

## Credits

The symbol data was gathered by many dedicated people. Some still around, some left. Regardless they're work is importaint, be it directly adding symbols, working on the Hack Pack, or making mods and furthuring our understanding the of the game.

### PPC

PPC and this decomp wouldn't exist without the work by [Encounter](https://github.com/encounter) and [the GC/Wii Decomp Server](https://discord.gg/hKx3FJJgrV).

I merely built ontop of the countless hours and months-years they spent to decomp projects and understanding the consoles.

Special thanks to Jinxy for helping get PPCC and PPC as far as it has with their technical knowledge. :3 - Jas
